    </div>
</div>

  <br>
<div class = "firstPara">
  <p>From the ages 6-18, American children attend elementary, middle, and high school. Many students pursue education beyond high school to earn the necessary degrees for certain careers. The American education system is a system designed to ensure a high-quality education for students to realize their potential as individuals, serve as citizens, and compete in society. To many’s dismay, the system does not nurture children, but instead it is detrimental to them and their mental health. </p>
</div>

<div class="secondPara">
<p>There is a greater emphasis on excelling in school rather than actually learning. Hence, many students’ approach to “learning” is not to comprehend the concepts, but to memorize the class curriculum. The knowledge is stored in their short-term memory and not their long-term memory. Students say that the teachers’ high expectations lower their self-esteem, and many struggle to balance their academic life, social life, and extracurriculars along with other commitments. </p>
</div>

<div class="thirdPara">
<p>Although the education system is meant to prepare students as citizens, many think that what they learn in school is of little use in the real world, where they need to understand credit and taxes, not trigonometry or algebraic equations. Bella Perrotta from Kent Roosevelt High School says, “Often, teachers will give me information and expect me to memorize it for a test without teaching me any real application.” To expand on that, learning is not very interactive and one reason is that teachers can spend days drilling into students what they need to know to pass standardized tests. </p>

    <h3> Substance Abuse </h3>
    <p>Due to extreme stress that students face, many of them may turn to unhealthy coping mechanisms, such as drugs and alcohol. Futhermore, there are students who become involved with substances in order to focus better or sleep more. Either way, they enter an endless cycle they are trapped in. <a href="https://sunrisehouse.com/addiction-demographics/high-school-college-students/"> Learn More </a> </p>
